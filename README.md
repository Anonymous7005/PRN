# Joint 3D Face Reconstruction and Dense Alignment with Position Map Regression Network

![prn](Docs/images/prnet.gif)

## Introduction

This is an official python implementation of PRN. 

PRN is a method to jointly regress dense alignment and 3D face shape in an end-to-end manner. 

The main features are:

* **End-to-End**  our method can directly regress the 3D facial structure and dense alignment from a single image bypassing 3DMM fitting.

* **Multi-task**  By regressing position map, the 3D geometry along with semantic meaning can be obtained. Thus, we can effortlessly complete the tasks of dense alignment, monocular 3D face reconstruction, etc.

* **Faster than real-time**  The method can run at more than 100fps(with GTX 1080) to regress a position map.

* **Robust** Tested on facial images in unconstrained conditions.  Our method is robust to poses, illuminations and occlusions.

## Applications

### Basics(Evaluated in paper)

* #### Face Alignment

Dense alignment of both visible and non-visible points(including 68 key points). 

![alignment](Docs/images/alignment.jpg)

* #### 3D Face Reconstruction

Get the 3D vertices and corresponding colors from a single image.  Save the result as mesh data, which can be open with [Meshlab](http://www.meshlab.net/) or Microsoft [3D Builder](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/3d-print/3d-builder-resources). Notice that, the texture of non-visible area is distorted due to self-occlusion.

### More(To be added)

* #### 3D Pose Estimation

* #### Texture Fusion




## Getting Started

### Prerequisite

* Python 2.7 (numpy, skimage, scipy)

* TensorFlow >= 1.4

  Optional:

* dlib (for detecting face, you do not have to install if you can provide bounding box information)

* opencv2 (for extracting textures)

### Usage

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anonymous7005/PRN.git
cd PRN
```

2. Download the [PRN model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UoE-XuW1SDLUjZmJPkIZ1MLxvQFgmTFH/view?usp=sharing), and copy it into `Data/net-data`
3. Run the test code.

```bash
python test_basics.py
```
